Structural variation refers to alterations spanning large segments of the DNA sequence. Variants located in cancer predisposition genes may be mosaic, because of de-novo post-zygotic mutation, and may confer an increased risk of an individual developing multiple primary tumours. There are few studies exploring mosaic structural variation in cancer predisposition genes. Therefore, the research is important because it seeks to fill the gap in the literature on this under-researched topic. 

The exploratory study analyses secondary sequenced cancer gene panel data from a cohort of 71 patients with multiple primary tumours, produced by the Cancer Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, at the University of Cambridge. All selected patients had been referred to a clinical geneticist, due to a clinical suspicion of a cancer predisposition syndrome without a known cause. The dataset underwent thorough bioinformatic analysis, utilising the R programming language. The primary aim of the study was to detect potential somatic mosaic structural variants occurring in established cancer predisposition genes. By examining multiple primary tumour samples from patients and comparing them to the corresponding germline (blood) samples, the cases where specific structural variants were found exclusively in at least two tumour samples but not in the blood sample, were analysed.
